## Project Title:  Predicting Car Prices and Fuel Efficiency Using Machine Learning


### Authors:
- Kaulan Serzhanuly
- Mahir Islam

### Description of Question and Research Topic (5 Sentences):
This project looks at using the machine learning tools we used in class to predict used car prices and car fuel efficiency based off real-world datasets.
Each team member focuses on one dataset:
- **Author 1:** Car Price Prediction
- **Author 2:** Fuel Efficiency Prediction
For car prices, we will compare a Decision Tree with a Multi-Layer Perceptron.
For fuel efficiency, we compare a Linear Regression model with a MLP to see how non-linear learning affects accuracy.
We want to see which model performs better for each task and understand how they differ in accuracy.

***Project Outline/Plan:***
	Data Collection Plan (two parts, one for each author):
	- **Car Price Dataset:** [Kaggle Car Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction)
    - **Fuel Efficiency Dataset:** [UCI Auto MPG Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg)
	
***Model Plans (two parts, one for each author):***

#### Author 1 – Car Price Prediction
- **Models:**
  1. Multi-Layer Perceptron
  2. Decision Tree
- **Goal:** Compare and contrast two models
#### Author 2 – Fuel Efficiency (MPG) Prediction
- **Models:**
  1. Linear Regression
  2. Multi-Layer Perceptron
