## Project Title:  Predicting Car Prices and Fuel Efficiency Using Machine Learning


### Authors:
- Kaulan Serzhanuly – Fuel Efficiency Prediction  
- Mahir Islam – Car Price Prediction  

### Project Overview
This project investigates how different machine learning models—both classical and neural network–based—perform on **real-world automotive regression tasks**.

We study two prediction problems:
1. **Car Price Prediction** (Mahir)  
2. **Fuel Efficiency (MPG) Prediction** (Kaulan)

For each dataset, we compare  different **traditional ML model** and a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** neural network to evaluate how nonlinear learning affects performance.  
Our goal is to determine **which model generalizes better**, understand why, and interpret key predictive factors.

### Environment Setup & Reproducibility
This project was run using the cs171 Conda environment set up at the beginning of the course using the professor’s instructions.
The environment includes Python 3.12, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and torch. The notebook runs top-to-bottom without configuration changes.


### Description of Question and Research Topic (5 Sentences):
This project looks at using the machine learning tools we used in class to predict car prices and car fuel efficiency based off real-world datasets.
Each team member focuses on one dataset:
- **Mahir Islam:** Car Price Prediction
- **Kaulan Serzhanuly:** Fuel Efficiency Prediction

For car prices, we will compare *Linear Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Voting, and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP).*
For fuel efficiency, we compare a *Linear Regression* model with a *MLP* to see how non-linear learning affects accuracy.
We want to see which model performs better for each task and understand how they differ in accuracy and error.
